                    This page is meant to introduce my somewhat overweight (but very cute) cats!

                    <h5>Syver</h5>
                    One of my cats is named Syver (pronounced like silver, minus the "l"). She really likes licking things and is not at all shy.
                    <br><br>
                    She also really enjoys sitting in inconvenient spots, as many cats do. For example, this time, she found a bunch of paper next to our fireplace and
                    decided it would make a great napping spot:

                    <br><br>
                    She also enjoys helping me do my school-work: <br><br>
                    <img src="images/syver2.png" alt="Another image of Syver taking a nap" style="width:30%">

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5>Scamper</h5>
                    My other cat is named Scamper. She isn't quite as social as Syver, but is just as good at napping.
                    <br><br>
                    She similarly really enjoys sitting in interesting spots. Take, for example, her tendency to sleep behind our fireplace during the winter. I am
                    constantly amazed she doesn't find it way too hot back there!
                    <br>
                    <img src="images/scamper1.png" alt="Image of Scamper napping behind the fireplace" style="width:40%">
                    <br><br>
                    She also enjoys sunbeams (we've decided she's sort of like butter -- warm her up a bit and she just sort of melts): <br><br>
                    <img src="images/scamper2.png" alt="Scamper napping on a windowsill" style="width:50%">
                    <br><br>
                    And those are my cats!
